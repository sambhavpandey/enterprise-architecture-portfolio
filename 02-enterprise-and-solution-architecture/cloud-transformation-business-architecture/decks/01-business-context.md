## Technology Landscape (Current State)

Northstar Digital Group’s technology landscape has evolved over time and includes:

- Core ERP systems supporting finance, procurement, and manufacturing  
- Supply chain and logistics applications  
- Operational reporting and analytics platforms  
- Custom-built and packaged applications supporting regional needs  

Most systems are hosted in **legacy, on-premises data centers**, resulting in:

- Regionally fragmented environments  
- High infrastructure and maintenance costs  
- Limited scalability during demand fluctuations  
- Long lead times for provisioning and change

## Business Challenges

The current operating and technology environment presents several challenges:

- Slow delivery of new digital capabilities to support manufacturing and supply chain optimization  
- Limited real-time visibility into operational and financial data  
- Difficulty scaling systems to support business growth and volatility  
- High operational overhead and limited cost transparency  
- Inconsistent governance and security controls across regions  

These challenges directly impact agility, resilience, and cost efficiency.
