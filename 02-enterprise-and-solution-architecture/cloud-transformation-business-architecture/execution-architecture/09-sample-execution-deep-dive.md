# Cloud Transformation Business Architecture
## Northstar Digital Group (Fictional Case Study)

### Overview
This repository presents a fictional but realistic **Enterprise Business Architecture case study**
demonstrating how cloud transformation can be designed, governed, and executed at scale for a
global manufacturing and distribution enterprise.

The case study is structured to reflect how a real-world enterprise architecture engagement
would be delivered, covering strategy, value streams, capabilities, operating model, and
a phased transformation roadmap.

> **Disclaimer**  
> This is a fictional enterprise architecture case study created solely for learning and
> portfolio demonstration purposes. Any resemblance to real organizations is coincidental.

## Enterprise Context

**Organization:** Northstar Digital Group  
**Industry:** Global Manufacturing and Distribution  

Northstar Digital Group operates multi-region manufacturing plants supported by a global
supplier and distribution network. The organization relies heavily on ERP, supply chain,
and operational systems that have historically been hosted in legacy, on-premises data centers.

Increasing cost pressure, supply chain volatility, and the need for faster digital innovation
have driven the enterprise to initiate a structured cloud transformation program.

## Architecture Approach

This case study follows a **business-first enterprise architecture approach**, where
cloud is treated as a strategic enabler rather than a technology refresh.

The architecture is built through five tightly connected artefacts:

1. **Business Strategy View**  
2. **Value Stream View**  
3. **Business Capability Map**  
4. **Target Operating Model**  
5. **Transformation Roadmap**

Each artefact builds on the previous one, ensuring traceability from strategy to execution.
