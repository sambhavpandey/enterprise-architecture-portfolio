## Overview

This repository contains a complete, end-to-end enterprise architecture case study built using the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM).

The case study represents a fictional but realistic global enterprise and demonstrates how enterprise architecture can be used to translate business strategy into executable technology and transformation roadmaps.

This work is created for:

* Personal learning and mastery of enterprise architecture
* Building a professional architecture portfolio
* Demonstrating consulting-grade thinking and structure

## Case Study Summary

Client Type: Global Manufacturing Enterprise (Fictional)
Role: Lead Enterprise Architect

Business challenges addressed:

* Fragmented technology landscape across regions
* High IT operating costs
* Slow product launch cycles
* Limited data visibility
* No formal architecture governance

Objectives:

* Align business strategy with technology
* Reduce cost and complexity
* Enable data-driven decisions
* Prepare for automation and AI
* Establish enterprise architecture governance

## Structure of the Repository

The repository follows the TOGAF ADM phases and supporting architecture artefacts.

```
00-context-and-vision/              → Phase A – Architecture Vision
01-business-architecture/           → Phase B – Business Architecture
02-information-systems-architecture → Phase C – Data & Application Architecture
03-technology-architecture/         → Phase D – Technology Architecture
04-opportunities-and-solutions/     → Phase E – Opportunities & Solutions
05-migration-planning/              → Phase F – Migration Planning
06-implementation-governance/       → Phase G – Implementation Governance
07-change-management/               → Phase H – Architecture Change Management
08-cross-cutting/                   → Cross-phase artefacts
assets/                             → Diagrams, tables, and visuals
```

Each folder contains artefacts aligned to the corresponding TOGAF phase.

## What You Will Find Inside

This case study includes:

* Business drivers, goals, and architecture vision
* Value streams and business capability mapping

## How to Navigate

1. Start with `00-context-and-vision` to understand the business problem and vision
2. Move to `01-business-architecture` to see how business capabilities and operating models are defined
3. Explore `02` and `03` for information systems and technology architectures
4. Review `04` and `05` for solution design and migration planning
5. Use `06` and `07` to understand governance and change management
6. Refer to `08-cross-cutting` for business case, traceability, and metrics

## Tools and Frameworks Used

* TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM)
* Capability-based planning
* Business-driven architecture design
* Cloud-first and data-driven architecture principles
* Governance-by-design

## Purpose of This Work

This repository is not based on a real client.
It is a synthesized, realistic case designed to:

* Demonstrate enterprise architecture thinking
* Show structured use of TOGAF
* Provide a reference model for future projects
* Act as a professional portfolio artefact
