# Enterprise Architecture & Transformation Portfolio

This repository is a curated professional portfolio showcasing **enterprise-scale thinking across strategy, architecture, execution, analytics, and leadership**.

It brings together **business architecture, cloud transformation, program delivery, business analysis, analytics, and strategic problem-solving** into a single, coherent body of work — designed for **recruiters, interviewers, and senior stakeholders**.

The artefacts in this repository are **practical, execution-aware, and business-led**, reflecting real-world enterprise challenges rather than academic exercises.
