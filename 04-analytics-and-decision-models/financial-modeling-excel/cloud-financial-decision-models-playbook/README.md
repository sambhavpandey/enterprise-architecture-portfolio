# Cloud Financial Decision Models – Excel Playbook

This Excel workbook is a **collection of cloud financial and architectural decision models**, each implemented as a separate use case across multiple sheets.

Rather than a single calculator, this playbook demonstrates how financial analysis supports **real enterprise cloud decisions** under uncertainty, variability, and trade-offs.
